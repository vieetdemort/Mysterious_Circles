# Mysterious_Circles

```python
print("Hi, my name is Nazim! ")
```
In the file dataset.csv you will find a synthetic selection. It contains 5 attributes and one target variable.

It is necessary to train a classifier with the highest generalization ability on this data. The metric used to evaluate the quality of the classifier is ROC-AUC. It should be noted in advance that if it is not possible to obtain a ROC-AUC above 70%, it means that some strong characters have not been invented. At the same time, it is suggested to pay attention not only to the accuracy of the classifier, but also to the design of the code, the study of the data, and a competent assessment of the quality of the resulting model - all this is also evaluated, and some of it can also help to create a better model.

The solution must be submitted in the form of a Python script or a Jupiter Notebook. Comments and diagrams are welcome.

```python
print("Thank You")
```
